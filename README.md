The sports betting market has been on the rise due to a recent wave of changes to legislation. On the whole, the industry is expected to grow by 8 billion  in the next 5 years.* In order to capitalize on the expected growth, we are using machine learning to predict outcomes in NBA regular season games. 

Since the strength of a team is heavily dependent upon them having star players, we decided to take a player centric approach in predicting matchups. Our training set is comprised of player advanced stats, usage stats and average box scores. The average box scores are calculated by equally weighing the scores from each individual game a home team starter and away team starter were in for a lookback period of 2 years.   -->
